defining get_absolute_url to redirect to profile/login page after creating a user

CloudMessageView is not checked because identity is not verified in kavenegar


uploading several images ONE BY ONE
updating the uploaded images

messages (back to front) in signing up (maybe should be deleted)

sportclubs should change their password in first_login

salons is_confirmed field must be set to False when sportclubs updates them

salons must have a pending filed that when a masteruser told them to change your salon other masterusers
doesn't see that salon in unpublished list

restrict length to be chosen from dropdown menu

url mapping for commonusers to see salon list

later when a sportclub or a salon is banned all booked money should return to their related users
and inform them with a message or email



masterusers should update their pictures and password

for setting price in sessions with sportclub their bank account details must be defined


fixing redirect for superuser required login page


setting the KavenegarAPI and sender number and email sender to secret key later



def get_success_url(self):
		slug = self.kwargs['slug']
		return reverse("accounts:profile", kwargs={'slug': slug})

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when masteruser deletes or banes sth he should send an email of why to the owner

everything that a master user done must be result in a reverse to a profile page because
e.g. we can ban a salon from two ways and they should not endup both in the unconfirmedsalon list

deleting the confirm page for delete and ban and unbaning masterusers via superusers

in front part all delete ban or unbans must be asked for a confirm in a pop up show

prefix for urls for adding the ability to other usages of this website

page for admin profile and settings

time model must be generated daily automatically for 1 year length

		u = models.UserModel.objects.get(username__exact=username)
		password = data.get('new_password')

		try:
				validate_password(password,user=u, password_validators=None)
				u.set_password(password)
				u.save()
				return redirect("accounts:success")
		except:
				error1 ='کلمه عبور باید بیش از 6 کاراکتر باشد'
				error2 ='کلمه عبور باید نمیتواند شامل نام کاربری باشد'
				error3 ='کلمه عبور نمیتواند خیلی ساده باشد'
				return render(request,'accounts/rp_2.html',{'form':form,'error1':error1,'error2':error2,'error3':error3})

updating datas via Functions
def func(request, id):
    object = Model.objects.get(id=id) # or with get_object_or_404
